# Computing the Parity of a Word

"Parity checks are used to detect single bit errors in data storage and communication." - EPI  
  
The parity of a binary word is 1 if the number of 1s in the word is odd. Conversely, the parity of a binary word is 0 if the number of 1s in the word is even.  
  
Examples:  
1011 -> 1  
1001 -> 0  
100100 -> 0  
111000 -> 1
