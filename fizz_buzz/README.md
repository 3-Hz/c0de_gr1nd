# Fizz Buzz

Problem:  
Write a program that outputs the string representation of numbers from 1 to n.   
For each multiple of 3, print 'Fizz' instead of the number.   
For each multiple of 5, print 'Buzz' instead of the number.   
For numbers which are multiples of both 3 and 5, print 'FizzBuzz' instead of the number.  
  
Example:  
```
n = 15,

Return:
[
    "1",
    "2",
    "Fizz",
    "4",
    "Buzz",
    "Fizz",
    "7",
    "8",
    "Fizz",
    "Buzz",
    "11",
    "Fizz",
    "13",
    "14",
    "FizzBuzz"
]
```
