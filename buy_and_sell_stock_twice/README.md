Examples:  
```  
 Input: [0.3, 0.1, 0.4, 0.1]
Output: 0.3
Conclusion: First buy at 0.3 and sell at 0.3, and second buy at 0.1 and sell at 0.4

 Input: [0.2, 0.7, 0.9, 0.4, 0.1, 0.1, 0.5, 0.4, 0.9]	
Output: 1.5
Conclusion: First buy at 0.2 and sell at 0.9, and second buy at 0.1 and sell at 0.9

 Input: [0.9, 0.8, 0.8, 0.8, 0.7, 0.2, 1.0, 0.5, 0.6, 1.1, 0.7, 0.3]
Output: 1.4
Conclusion: First buy at 0.2 and sell at 1.0, and second buy at 0.5 and sell at 1.1
