# Advancing Through an Array     
  
Problem:  
Write a program which takes an array of n integers, where A[i] denotes the maximum you can advance from index i, and returns whether it is possible to advance to the last index starting from the beginning of the array.    
    
Examples:  
```  
[3, 3, 1, 0, 2, 0, 1] = True, a valid advance sequence is: 0 -> 1 -> 4 -> 6 -> 6
[3, 2, 0, 0, 2, 0, 1] = False
```  
    
Solution - from [advance-by-offsets-mysol.py](advance-by-offsets-mysol.py):  
```python
def can_reach_end(A):
    # TODO - you fill in here.
    return True
```
