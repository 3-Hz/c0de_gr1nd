# Compute a Random Permutation
Design an algorithm that creates uniformly random permutations of [0, 1, ... , _n_-1]. You are given a random number generator that returns in the set [0, 1, ... , _n_-1] with equal probability; use as few calls to it as possible.  
  
## Examples
```
BLANK
```
  
## Solution
```python
def compute_random_permutation(n):
    # TODO - you fill in here.
    return []s
```
