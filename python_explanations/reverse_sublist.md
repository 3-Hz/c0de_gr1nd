# Reverse a Single Sublist
This problem is concerned with reversing a sublist within a list.  
  
Write a program which takes a singly linked list _L_ and two integers _s_ and _f_ as arguments, and reverses the order of the nodes from the *s*th node to *f*th node, inclusive. The numbering begins at 1, i.e., the head node is the first node. Do not allocate additional nodes.
  
## Example
```
s = 2
f = 4

 Input: [L] -> [1] -> [2] -> [3] -> [4] -> [7]
Output: [L] -> [1] -> [4] -> [3] -> [2] -> [7]
```
  
## Solution
```python
def reverse_sublist(L, start, finish):
    # TODO - you fill in here.
    return None
```
