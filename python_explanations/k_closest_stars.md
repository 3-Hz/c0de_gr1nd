# Compute the *k* Closest Stars
Consider a coordinate system for the Milky Way, in which Earth is at (0,0,0). Model stars as points, and assume distances are in light years. The Milky Way consists of approximately 10<sup>12</sup> stars, and their coordinates are stored in a file.

How would you compute the *k* stars which are closest to Earth?

## Example
```
 Input: k = 2
        [
     [-1794.8070372385318, -9120.626275560508, -2021.3955677174254],
     [6945.623209746882, 8283.632617219755, 9623.435301592799],
     [9263.718591572451, 656.5773156171654, -1503.123327920437],
     [6670.133011049249, 2279.2320407562183, -4073.4724736107464],
     [-5026.933414485983, 4445.885340427358, -1120.6910284437745],
     [2210.0812228916748, 595.7866615882303, -5213.652239247229],
     [6575.568191268754, 672.3147857301883, 6332.234818341198],
     [-3684.2924115999813, -3833.0027029766643, -248.96523550172606]
 ]
Output: [5322.396451194523, 5693.995998392733]
