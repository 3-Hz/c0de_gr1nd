# Implement Even-Odd Merge
Consider a singly linked list whose nodes are numbered starting at 0. Define the even-odd merge of the list to be the list of the even-numbered nodes followed by the odd-numbered nodes.  
  
Write a program that computes the even-odd merge.
  
## Example
```
 Input: L -> [0] -> [1] -> [2] -> [3] -> [4] -> None
Output: L -> [0] -> [2] -> [4] -> [1] -> [3] -> None
```
  
## Solution
