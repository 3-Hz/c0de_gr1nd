# Compute the *k*th Node in an Inorder Traversal
Write a program that efficiently computes the *k*th node appearing in an inorder traversal. Assume that each node stores the number of nodes in the subtree rooted at that node.

## Example
```
       1
      / \
     2   3
    / \
   7   5

Inorder Traversal: [7, 2, 5, 1, 3]

 Input: [1, 2, 3, 7, 5, null, null]
        k = 3
Output: 5
```
