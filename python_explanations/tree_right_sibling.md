# Compute the Right Sibling Tree
For this problem, assume that each binary tree node has an extra field, call it level-next, that holds a binary tree node (this field is distinct from the fields for the left and right children). The level-next field will be used to compute a map from nodes to their right siblings. The input is assumed to be a perfect binary tree.

Write a program that takes a perfect binary tree, and sets each node's level-next field to the node on its right, if one exists.

## Example
```
Input:            Output:
        11                 11-->None
       /  \               /  \
      2    3             2--->3-->None
     / \  / \           / \  / \
    4  5  6  7         4->5->6->7-->None
```
