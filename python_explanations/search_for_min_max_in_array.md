# Find the Min and Max Simultaneously
Given an array of comparable objects, you can find either the _min_ or the _max_ of the elements in the array with _n_ - 1 comparisons, where _n_ is the length of the array.

Design an algorithm to find the min and max elements in an array.

## Examples
```
 Input: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
Output: [1, 5]

 Input: [5, -4, -6, 5, -3, 7, 5, -3]
Output: [-6, 7]
```

## Solution
