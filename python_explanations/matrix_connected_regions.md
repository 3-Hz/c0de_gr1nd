# Paint a Boolean Matrix
Given an image represented by a binary matrix and a starting position (_x_, _y_), flip the colors of any adjacent cells opposite to the starting color (1 or 0) in the same region. The region is defined by the path that can be navigated from the starting point via the same color.

## Examples
```
 Input: x = 0, y = 0
        [[0, 1, 0],
         [1, 0, 1],
         [0, 1, 1]]
Output: [[1, 1, 0],
         [1, 0, 1],
         [0, 1, 1]]

 Input: x = 1, y = 0
        [[1, 0, 0],
         [1, 1, 0],
         [1, 0, 0]]
Output: [[0, 0, 0],
         [0, 0, 0],
         [0, 0, 0]]
```
