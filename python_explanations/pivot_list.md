# Implement List Pivoting
For any integer _k_, the pivot of a list of integers with respect to _k_ is that list with its nodes reordered so that all nodes containing keys less than _k_ appear before nodes containing _k_, and all nodes containing keys greater than _k_ appear after the nodes containing _k_.  
  
Implement a function which takes as input a singly linked list and an integer _k_ and performs a pivot of the list with respect to _k_. The relative ordering of nodes that appear before _k_, and after _k_, must remain unchanged; the same must hold for nodes holding keys equal to _k_.
