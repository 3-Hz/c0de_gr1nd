# Compute the Successor
The successor of a node in a binary tree is the node that appears immediately after the given node in an inorder traversal.

Design an algorithm that computes the successor of a node in a binary tree. Assume that each node stores its parent.

## Example
```
       1
      / \
     2   3
    / \
   7   5

Inorder Traversal: [7, 2, 5, 1, 3]

 Input: 5
Output: 2
```

## Solution
```python
BLANK
```
