# Permute the Elements of an Array
A permutation is a rearrangement of members of a sequence into a new sequence. A permutation can be specified by an array _P_, where _P_[_i_] represents the location of the element at _i_ in the permutation.  
  
Given an array _A_ of _n_ elements and a permutation _P_, apply _P_ to _A_  
  
## Examples
```
A = [5, 0, 2, 1, 4, 3]
P = [3, 0, 5, 4, 2, 1]
Output: [0, 3, 4, 5, 1, 2]

A = [4, 5, 0, 3, 2, 1]
P = [5, 4, 3, 1, 2, 0]
Output: [1, 3, 2, 0, 5, 4]
```
  
## Solution
