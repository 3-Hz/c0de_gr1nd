# Check if a Decimal Integer is a Palindrome
A palindromic string is one which reads the same forwards and backwards, such as the string 'racecar'.  
Write a program which determines if the decimal representation of an integer is a palindromic string.  
  
## Examples
```
0    -> True
11   -> True
215  -> False
-1   -> False
777  -> True
```
  
## Solution
```python
def is_palindrome_number(x):
    if x < 0:
        return False
    return x == int(str(x)[::-1])
```
  
## Explanation
* The solution checks for palindromicity by comparing _x_ to its reversed representation that is generated using slice notation
* Generating the reversed string representation of _x_ and then converting it back to an integer does create a new object that adds additional space complexity, however, it still outperforms an in-place solution that involves using several arithmetic operations in a loop
* While not using bitwise operators is against the goal of the problem, 3 lines of readable explicit code that performs faster than a math-heavy algorithm is, in my opinion, a better solution
  
## Code Dissection
1. If _x_ is negative, its decimal representation cannot be palindromic  
    ```python
    if x < 0:
        return False
    ```
2. Check if _x_ is palindromic by comparing its reversed representation generated by using slice notation
    ```python
    return x == int(str(x)[::-1])
    ```
