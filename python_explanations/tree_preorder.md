# Implement a Preorder Traversal Without Recursion
Write a program which takes as input a binary tree and performs a preorder traversal of the tree. Do not use recursion. Nodes do not contain parent references.

## Example
```
       1
      / \
     2   3
    / \
   7   5

 Input: [1, 2, 3, 7, 5, null, null]
Output: [1, 2, 7, 5, 3]
```
