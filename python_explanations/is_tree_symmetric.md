# Test If a Binary Tree Is Symmetric
A binary tree is symmetric if you can draw a vertical line through the root and then the left subtree is the mirror image of the right subtree.

Write a program that checks whether a binary tree is symmetric.

## Examples
```
    1
   / \
  2   2
 / \ / \
3  4 4  3

 Input: [1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 4, 3]
Output: True


    1
   / \
  2   2
   \   \
   3    3

 Input: [1, 2, 2, null, 3, null, 3]
Output: False
```
