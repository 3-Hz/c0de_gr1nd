# Implement Cyclic Right Shift for Singly Linked Lists
Write a program that takes as input a singly linked list and a nonnegative integer _k_, and returns the list cyclically shifted to the right by _k_.
  
## Example
```
k = 3

 Input: L -> [1] -> [2] -> [3] -> [4] -> [5] -> None
Output: L -> [3] -> [4] -> [5] -> [1] -> [2] -> None
```
  
## Solution
```python
def cyclically_right_shift_list(L, k):
    # TODO - you fill in here.
    return None
```
