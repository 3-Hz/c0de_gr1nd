# Find a Root to Leaf Path with Specified Sum
You are given a binary tree where each node is labeled with an integer. The path weight of a node in such a tree is the sum of the integers on the unique path from the root to that node.

Write a program which takes as input an integer and a binary tree with integer node weights, and checks if there exists a leaf whose path weight equals the given integer.

## Examples
```
       1
      / \
     2   3
    / \
   7   5

 Input: [1, 2, 3, 7, 5, null, null]
        weight = 10
Output: True


 Input: [1, 2, 3, 7, 5, null, null]
        weight = 4
Output: True


 Input: [1, 2, 3, 7, 5, null, null]
        weight = 9
Output: False
```
