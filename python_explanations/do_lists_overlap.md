# Test for Overlapping Lists&mdash;Lists May Have Cycles
Write a program that takes two singly linked lists, and determines if there exists a node that is common to both lists. The lists may each or both have a cycle. If such a node exists, return a node that appears first when traversing the lists. This node may not be unique&mdash;if one node ends in a cycle, the first cycle node encountered when traversing it may be different from the first cycle node encountered when traversing the second list, even though the cycle is the same. In such cases, you may return either of the two nodes.
