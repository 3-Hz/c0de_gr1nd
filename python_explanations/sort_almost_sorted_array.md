# Sort an Almost-Sorted Array
Write a program which takes as input a very long sequence of numbers and prints the numbers in sorted order. Each number is at most _k_ away from its correctly sorted position.

## Examples
```
 Input: [1, 2, 0, 3]
        k = 4
Output: [0, 1, 2, 3]

 Input: [-5, -3, -2, -5, 3]
        k = 5
Output: [-5, -5, -3, -2, 3]
```

## Solution

BLANK
```
