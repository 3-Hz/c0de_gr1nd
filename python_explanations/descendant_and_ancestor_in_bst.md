# Test If Three BST Nodes Are Totally Ordered
Given two nodes in a BST, check if one is an ancestor and the other a descendant of the given middle node.

## Examples
```
        4
       / \
      2   5
     / \
    1   3

 Input:  node0 = 1
         node1 = 4
        middle = 2
Output: True
Conclusion: 4 is an ancestor of 2
            1 is a descendant of 2


 Input:  node0 = 1
         node1 = 3
        middle = 2
Output: False
Conclusion: 1 and 3 are descendants of 2
```
