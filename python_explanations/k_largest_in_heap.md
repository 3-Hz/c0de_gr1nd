# Compute the _k_ Largest Elements in a Max-Heap
Given a max-heap, represented as an array _A_, design an algorithm that computes the _k_ largest elements stored in the max-heap. You cannot modify the heap.

## Examples
```
 Input: k = 3
        [4, 3, 2, 1, 0]
Output: [4, 3, 2]

 Input: k = 2
        [8, 7, 6, 4, 2, 2, 4, 1, 3]
Output: [8, 7]
```

## Solution
```python
BLANK
