# Sample Offline Data
This problem is motivated by the need for a company to select a random subset of its customers to roll out a new feature to.  
  
Implement an algorithm that takes as input an array of distinct elements and a size, and returns a subset of the given size of the array of elements. All subsets should be equally likely. Return the result in input array itself.  
  
## Examples
```
 Input: [1, 2, 3, 4]
Output:

Output:

 Input: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
Output:
