# Enumerate All Primes to _n_
A natural number is called a prime if it is bigger than 1 and has no divisors other than 1 and itself.  
  
Write a program that takes an integer argument and returns all the primes between 1 and that integer.  
  
## Example
```
 Input: 18
Output: [2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17]
```
  
## Solution
```python
def generate_primes(n):
    # TODO - you fill in here.
    return []
```
