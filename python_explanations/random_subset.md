# Compute a Random Subset
Write a program that takes as input a positive integer _n_ and a size _k_ <= _n_, and returns a size-_k_ subset of [0, 1, 2, ... , _n_-1]. The subset should be represented as an array. All subsets should be equally likely and, in addition, all permutations of elements of the array should be equally likely. You may assume you have a function which takes as input a nonnegative integer _t_ and returns an integer in the set [0, 1, ... , _t_-1] with uniform probability.  
  
## Examples
```
BLANK
```
  
## Solution
```python
def random_subset(n, k):
    # TODO - you fill in here.
    return []
```
