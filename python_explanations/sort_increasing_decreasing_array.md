# Sort an Increasing-Decreasing Array
An array is said to be _k_-increasing-decreasing if elements repeteadly increase up to a certain index after which they decrease, then again increase, a total of _k_ times.

Design an efficient algorithm for sorting a *k*-increasing-decreasing array.

## Examples
```
 Input: [1, 2, 3, 2, 1, 4, 5, 10, 9, 4, 4, 1, -1]
Output: [-1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 4, 4, 5, 9, 10]

 Input: [2147483647, 8, 4, 2, 1, 0, -1, -2147483648]
Output: [-2147483648, -1, 0, 1, 2, 4, 8, 2147483647]
```
