# Merge Two Sorted Lists
Consider two singly linked lists in which each node holds a number. Assume the lists are sorted, i.e., numbers in the lists appear in ascending order within each list. The _merge_ of the two lists is a list consisting of the nodes of the two lists in which numbers appear in ascending order.  
  
Write a program that takes two lists, assumed to be sorted, and returns their merge. The only field your program can change in a node is its next field.
