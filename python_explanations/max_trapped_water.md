# Compute the Maximum Water Trapped by a Pair of Vertical Lines
Given an array of integers that represent vertical lines on a graph, find the maximum amount of water that can be trapped between 2 lines. Each number in the array represents the height of the line (_y_-axis), and its index is the position of the line (_x_-axis).

## Examples

```
 Input: [6, 5, 4, 2, 1, 9, 3, 6, 4]
Output: 42

The water is trapped between the vertical lines at x = 0 and x = 7.
Since the 2 lines are 7 spaces apart and both are 6 in height,
the water trapped = 7 * 6 = 42.
