# Generate Nonuniform Random Numbers
You are given _n_ numbers as well as probabilities _p_<sub>0</sub>, _p_<sub>1</sub>, ... , _p_ <sub>_n_-1</sub>, which sum up to 1. Given a random number generator that produces values in [0, 1) uniformly, how would you generate one of the _n_ numbers according to the specified probabilities?  
  
## Examples
```
BLANK
```
  
## Solution
```python
def nonuniform_random_number_generation(values, probabilities):
    # TODO - you fill in here.
    return 0
```
