# Test for Cyclicity
Although a linked list is supposed to be a sequence of nodes ending in null, it is possible to create a cycle in a linked list by making the next field of an element reference to one of the earlier nodes.  
  
Write a program that takes the head of a singly linked list and returns null if there does not exist a cycle, and the node at the start of the cycle, if a cycle is present. (You do not know the length of the list in advance.)
