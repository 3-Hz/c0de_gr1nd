# The Sudoku Checker Problem
Sudoku is a popular logic-based combinatorial number placement puzzle. The objective is to fill a 9 &times; 9 grid with digits subject to the constraint that each column, each row, and each of the nine 3 &times; 3 sub-grids that compose the grid contains unique integers in [1,9].  

Check whether a 9 &times; 9 2D array representing a partially completed Sudoku is valid. Specifically check that no row, column, or 3 &times; 3 2D subarray contains duplicates. A 0-value in the 2D array indicates that entry is blank; every other entry is in  
[1, 9].
