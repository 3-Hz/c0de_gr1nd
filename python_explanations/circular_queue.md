# Implement a Circular Queue
A queue can be implemented using an array and two additional fields, the beginning and the end indices. This structure is sometimes referred to as a circular queue. Both enqueue and dequeue have _O(1)_ time complexity. If the array is fixed, there is a maximum number of entries that can be stored. If the array is dynamically resized, the total time for _m_ combined enqueue and dequeue operations is _O(m)_.

Implement a queue API using an array for storing elements. Your API should include a constructor function, which takes as argument the initial capacity of the queue, enqueue and dequeue functions, and a function which returns the number of elements stored. Implement dynamic resizing to support storing an arbitrarily large number of elements.
