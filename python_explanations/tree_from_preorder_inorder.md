# Reconstruct a Binary Tree from Traversal Data
Many different binary trees yield the same sequence of keys in an inorder, preorder, or postorder traversal. However, given an inorder traversal and one of any two other traversal orders of a binary tree, there exists a unique binary tree that yields those orders, assuming each node holds a distinct key.

Given an inorder traversal sequence and a preorder traversal sequence of a binary tree, write a program to reconstruct the tree. Assume each node has a unique key.

## Example
```
 Input: preorder = [1, 2, 7, 5, 3]
         inorder = [7, 2, 5, 1, 3]
Output:
            1
           / \
          2   3
         / \
        7   5
```
