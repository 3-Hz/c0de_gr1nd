# Sum the Root-To-Leaf Paths in a Binary Tree
Consider a binary tree in which each node contains a binary digit. A root-to-leaf path can be associated with a binary number&mdash;the MSB is at the root.

Design an algorithm to compute the sum of the binary numbers represented by the root-to-leaf paths.

## Examples
```
    1
   / \
  0   1
 / \ / \
0  1 1  0

 Input: [1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0]
Output: 22

The binary numbers represented by this tree are:
    100 + 101 + 111 + 110 = 10110 (base 2)
                          = 22 (base 10)
```
