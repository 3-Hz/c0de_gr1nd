# Search for a Sequence in a 2D Array
Given a 2D array and a sequence of numbers, check if it's possible to traverse the sequence in the grid. The sequence must be traversed using adjacent squares in the correct order.

## Examples
```
2D Array: [[1, 2, 3],
           [4, 5, 6],
           [7, 8, 9]]

 Input: S = [1, 2, 5, 8]
Output: True

 Input: S = [1, 2, 3, 5]
Output: False
```
