# Compute Rows in Pascal's Triangle 
Write a program which takes as input a nonnegative integer _n_ and returns the first _n_ rows of Pascal's triangle.  
  
## Example
Here is a figure depicting the first five rows of a graphic that is known as Pascal's triangle:  
```
        -----
        | 1 |
      ---------
      | 1 | 1 |
    -------------
    | 1 | 2 | 1 |
  -----------------
  | 1 | 3 | 3 | 1 |
---------------------
| 1 | 4 | 6 | 4 | 1 |
---------------------
```
Each row contains one more entry than the previous one. Except for entries in the last row, each entry is adjacent to one or two numbers in the row below it. The first row holds 1. Each entry holds the sum of the numbers in the adjacent entries above it.  
  
## Solution
```python
def generate_pascal_triangle(n):
    # TODO - you fill in here.
    return []
```
