# Compute the Exterior of a Binary Tree
The exterior of a binary tree is the following sequence of nodes: the nodes from the root to the leftmost leaf, followed by the leaves in left-to-right order, followed by the nodes from the rightmost leaf to the root.

Write a program that computes the exterior of a binary tree.

## Example
```
        3
       / \
      5   1
     / \   \
    6   2   8
       / \
      9   4

 Input: [3, 5, 1, 6, 2, null, 8, null, null, 9, 4, null, null]
Output: [3, 5, 6, 9, 4, 8, 1, 3]

```
