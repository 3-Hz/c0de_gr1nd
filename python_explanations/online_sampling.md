# Sample Online Data
This problem is motivated by the design of a packet sniffer that provides a uniform sample of packets for a network session.  
  
Design a program that takes as input a size _k_, and reads packets, continuously maintaining a uniform random subset of size _k_ of the read packets.  
  
## Examples
```
BLANK
```
  
## Solution
```python
def online_random_sample(stream, k):
    # TODO - you fill in here.
    return []
```
