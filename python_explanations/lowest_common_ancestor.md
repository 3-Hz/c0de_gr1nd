# Compute the Lowest Common Ancestor in a Binary Tree
Any two nodes in a binary tree have a common ancestor, namely the root. The lowest common ancestor (LCA) of any two nodes in a binary tree is the node furthest from the root that is an ancestor of both nodes.

Design an algorithm for computing the LCA of two nodes in a binary tree in which nodes do not have a parent field.

## Examples
```
    3
   / \
  5   1
 / \ / \
6  2 0  8
  / \
 7   4

 Input: [3, 5, 1, 6, 2, 0, 8, null, null, 7, 4]
        node0 = 5
        node1 = 1
Output: 3

 Input: [3, 5, 1, 6, 2, 0, 8, null, null, 7, 4]
        node0 = 5
        node1 = 4
Output: 5
