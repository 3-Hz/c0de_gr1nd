# Swap Bits
"A 64-bit integer can be viewed as an array of 64 bits, with the bit at index 0 corresponding to the least significant bit (LSB), and the bit at index 63 corresponding to the most significant bit (MSB)." - EPI  
  
Problem:  
&nbsp;&nbsp;Write code that swaps the bits of a 64-bit integer at indices i and j.
