# Rectangle Intersection  
  
Problem:  
Write a program which tests if two rectangles have a nonempty intersection. If the intersection is nonempty, return the rectangle formed by their intersection.  
  
Examples:  
```
R1 = [36, 65, 69, 5],  R2 = [99, 83, 99, 61] -> No Intersection
R1 = [26, 12, 76, 62], R2 = [68, 59, 77, 28] -> Nonempty Intersection
R1 = [91, 39, 98, 41], R2 = [17, 41, 15, 7]  -> No Intersection
R1 = [17, 77, 58, 67], R2 = [5, 19, 32, 60]  -> Nonempty Intersection
```  
  
Solution - from [rectangle-intersection-mysol.py](rectangle-intersection-mysol.py):  
```python
def intersect_rectangle(R1, R2):
    # TODO - you fill in here.
    return Rectangle(0, 0, 0, 0)
```
