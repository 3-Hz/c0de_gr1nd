# Computer x * y without Arithmetical Operators

"Sometimes the processors used in ultra low-power devices such as hearing aids do not have dedicated hardware for performing multiplication. A program that needs to perform  multiplication must do so explicitly using lower-level primitives." - EPI  
  
Problem:  
Write a program that multiplies two nonnegative integers. The only operators you are allowed to use are:  
* assignment  
* the bitwise operators >>, <<, |, &, ~, ^  
* equality checks and Boolean combinations thereof  
  
Examples:  
```
3 * 4  = 12
7 * 7  = 49
5 * 2  = 10
10 * 8 = 80
```
