# Compute x / y
  
Problem:  
Given two positive integers, compute their quotient, using only the addition, subtraction, and shifting operators.   
  
Examples:  
```
12 / 4 = 3
7 / 7  = 1
10 / 5 = 2
42 / 7 = 6
```  
  
Solution - from [primitive-divide-mysol.py](primitive-divide-mysol.py):  
```python
def divide(x, y):
    return quotient
```
